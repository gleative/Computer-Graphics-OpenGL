/**
 * 
 * Represents a joint in a "skeleton". It contains the index of the joint which
 * determines where in the vertex shader uniform array the joint matrix for this
 * joint is loaded up to. It also contains the name of the bone, and a list of
 * all the child joints.
 * 
 * The "animatedTransform" matrix is the joint transform that I keep referring
 * to in the tutorial. This is the transform that gets loaded up to the vertex
 * shader and is used to transform vertices. It is a model-space transform that
 * transforms the joint from it's bind (original position, no animation applied)
 * position to it's current position in the current pose. Changing this
 * transform changes the position/rotation of the joint in the animated entity.
 * 
 * The two other matrices are transforms that are required to calculate the
 * "animatedTransform" in the {@link Animator} class. It also has the local bind
 * transform which is the original (no pose/animation applied) transform of the
 * joint relative to the parent joint (in bone-space).
 * 
 * The "localBindTransform" is the original (bind) transform of the joint
 * relative to its parent (in bone-space). The inverseBindTransform is that bind
 * transform in model-space, but inversed.
